# Building A Handwritten Digits Classifier using Cross Validation

In this project machine learning using k-fold cross validation is used to build a handwritten digits classifier.

At the start of this project I planned to use the standard library KFold from sklearn, but after a while I was curious if it was possible to write the code myself to get the same result. 
As a result the k-nearest neighbor algorithm with cross validation is used to build a handwritten digits classifier. 
For the cross validation the standard library Kfold is used and besides that I wrote the code myself to get the same results.
